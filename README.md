Employee Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict employee salaries based on factors like years of experience and job performance rating. It is designed to help organizations make fair, consistent, and data-driven compensation decisions.

Features
Predicts annual employee salary based on input features.
Interactive Streamlit web app for HR teams and analysts.
End-to-end workflow: data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
Linear Regression model with user-friendly interface and real-time prediction.
Visualization and analysis of key factors influencing salaries.

Technologies Used:- 
Python 3.7+

Streamlit for building the web application

pandas, numpy for data handling

scikit-learn for machine learning

matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization

joblib for model saving/loading

Developed with Visual Studio Code

Getting Started
Installation
Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Swarup0809/employee-salary-prediction.git
cd employee-salary-prediction

Usage
Launch the web application:

streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501

Enter employee details (experience, performance rating) to get salary predictions.
